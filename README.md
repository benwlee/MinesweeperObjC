# MinesweeperObjC

Minesweeper in Objective C. Currently, it is an 8x8 grip. You tap on a tile and it will disclose the number of mines surrounding it or end the game if it is a mine. If you long press a tile, it will be flagged as a mine. If you long press a flagged tile, then it will turn into a question mark. Long pressing a question mark will remove the mark. The marks just to help you mark tiles as mines or questionable if you need it. There are 10 mines scattered throughout the board. Once all non-mine tiles are uncovered, you win.

If you tap the "cheat" button, it will randomly select a non-mine tile and uncover it. Have fun!
